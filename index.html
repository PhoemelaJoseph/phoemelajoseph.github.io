    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the box was 2 smaller boxes to hold in the water and tubes. This is a possible solution because the 2 boxes have different cuts for the tube. 

    </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>When we collected data we observed that all the trails were the same because the more we put in the less that came out. For example in our first trial we put 500 ml but 0 ml came out. In our other trials we put 460 ml but only 425 ml was the result. The design wasn’t as inefficient because there was a lot of leaks in the design. To figure the idea in the actual box we listened to the box and tried to find out when the water would come out. Since we didn’t have stronger small boxes our outcome didn’t come out as planned.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning Part1<h/1>
    <p>During this process I saw mant other projects with very different models. We all had different ideas and had limits to our results. Our model compared to others was simple (not saying others were bad). Others were more complex for example using sponges, ramps, smaller and big tubes. But all models represented the inside of the black box.</p>
      <h1>Reasoning Part 2<h/1>
      <p>Since the first trial didn;t have any water come out I think our model/deisgn can be true. I believe this because the first trial on the black box no water came out and on the second only some came out. Both models had 500ml of water poured in. Our data is a little alike to the actual box because the numbers kept going up and down.</p>
      <h1>Reasoning Part 3<h/1>
      <p>If our claim weren’t true none of our trials would end out like this. We would of observed less water coming out because of leaks and lack of coverage in our box. We would’t have gotten far enough in our trials either.</p>
