    <p>Inside the box was 2 smaller boxes to hold in the water and tubes. This is a possible solution because the 2 boxes have different cuts for the tube.

    <h1>When we collected data we observed that all the trails were the same because the more we put in the less that came out. For example in our first trial we put 500 ml but 0 ml came out. In our other trials we put 460 ml but only 425 ml was the result. The design wasn’t as inefficient because there was a lot of leaks in the design. To figure the idea in the actual box we listened to the box and tried to find out when the water would come out. Since we didn’t have stronger small boxes our outcome didn’t come out as planned. </h1>
